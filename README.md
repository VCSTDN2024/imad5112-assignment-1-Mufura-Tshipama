4. Design Considerations
------------------------

```markdown
## Design Considerations

The design of the **[Meal app ]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: the app was crafted to provide an and easy navigation interface, ensuring users can quickly input the time of day and receive meal suggestions effortlessly.
   
2. **Responsiveness**:Meal suggestions are given to you based on the time of day, offering users appropriate meal options such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks.
   
3. **Simplicity**:  The design of the app is easy to fuction , focusing solely on the core feature of meal suggestion, avoiding unnecessary clutter.
   
4. **Performance**: The app is fast to respond it has given minimal impact on device resources like battery and memory
```

Why:
----
- Highlights the thought process behind the design choices. It demonstrates that students are considering not just the functionality, but also the usability and performance aspects of the app, which is a professional approach.

---

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
```markdown
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
```

Why:
----
- This section educates students on why they should understand version control (GitHub) and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------

```markdown
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [Briefly describe a challenge you faced, e.g.,The first time i tried to run my app it didnt not work because i did not add the ids for the button and the plain text ]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I went back to my mainactivity to add the ids for the button and the plain text"]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "I wanted to add a second screen to my app when you click the suugestion button it will bring you to another screen but it didnt work i had to restart my app 3 times because of that when i tried to run my app it was not lanching "]
   - **Solution**: [to solve the problem i just deleted the second screen and start all over with my app.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons that i always have to make sure that everything in my mainactivity has no error and i learnt how to code and improve my code as times goes on 
```

Why:
----
- Reflecting on challenges and solutions shows growth and problem-solving skills, which are critical for students. It also gives insight into their learning process, which can be valuable to employers.

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```markdown
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: ["Allowing users to input the exact time and not only the time of the day so it can give you a quick meal e.g.,"when it is morning and you dont input morning but the time the app will know that it is morning"]
2. **Feature 2**: [Integrating with a cloud database for storing user data, e.g., "the app willl be able to save your histro to know the most suggested time of day that the user inputs "]
3. **Feature 3**: [Adding a reminder that will remind them that they have not yet asked for a meal because if the user has not opened the app for an hour, e.g., "when you dont open the app in the morning for an hour after you wake up the app will assume that you have not yet eaten and it will send a reminder to not forget to have your breakfast "]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
```

Why:
----
- Suggesting future improvements shows forward thinking and a desire to continuously improve. It also demonstrates that the student has a clear vision for the app beyond the current assignment.
